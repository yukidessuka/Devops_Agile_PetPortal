            <h2>Rabbits in The Home</h2>
            <p>Rabbits can be difficult to handle: Rabbits often resist being picked up, and if not handled correctly, they can become afraid and kick, bite, or scratch. They can also injure themselves trying to escape. House rabbits are not a good "first pet" for children: In addition to being difficult to handle, rabbits may take more time to feel comfortable around people and bond with them. This can require patience, and may be difficult for small children to understand. Although rabbits play, they are less likely to interact with people and toys, unlike dogs and cats who enjoy games of fetch and pouncing on toys manipulated by people. A rabbit will need to be cared for by an adult who can provide the proper diet and sanitation. Rabbits can make excellent and interesting pets for older, quieter children.
                This is one of the reasons rabbits may not make ideal pets for small children, who like to hug or cuddle their pet. Rabbits can be also be destructive. Rabbits are natural chewers, and they do not know the difference between chewing on appropriate items or inappropriate ones such as electrical cords, furniture, and books. You will need to "rabbit proof" whatever areas in your house your rabbit is allowed access to. You will need to provide your rabbit with suitable chewing toys and constructive ways to burn off energy.
                Unneutered rabbits will usually display territorial marking: Male and female rabbits who are house pets should be neutered. This will decrease the risk of territorial marking and neutered rabbits tend to be easier to litter train. Neutering also decreases aggression and the tendency to chew. Most rabbits are neutered between the ages of 3 and 6 months. And of course, if neutered, you will not have to worry about them "breeding like rabbits."</p>

            <h2>Rabbit Diet and Health</h2>
            <p>Rabbits are herbivores. Most pet owners are familiar with dogs and cats, who eat food out of a can or bag. Rabbits will need hay and fresh pellets which may not be as readily available. They should also be fed fresh vegetables daily. Rabbits have certain health concerns you should be aware of. House rabbits will need regular veterinary health exams, just like other pets. Overgrown teeth, foot problems, digestive problems, and respiratory diseases are the most common disease conditions, and are more common in rabbits who are not housed correctly or given the proper diet. Before acquiring a rabbit, identify a knowledgeable veterinarian in your area who may also be helpful in providing you a good source for healthy rabbits.</p>
            <p>House rabbits require exercise. They should not be kept isolated in a small cage, but be allowed to daily move about in an exercise run or rabbit-proofed room.</p>


        <section>
            <h2>How Much Time Do Rabbits Need?</h2>
            <p>Rabbits require a time commitment. They will need daily attention to their diet, fresh water, and clean cages. To prevent obesity, most adult rabbits should be fed twice a day, and not have pellets always available. They need daily attention such as grooming, affection, and mental stimulation. They are social, and do not do well in isolation. Like dogs and cats, well-cared for rabbits can live into their teens. Rabbits come in various sizes, breeds, and have individual personalities. As with other pets, rabbits develop their own personalities.</p>  
            <p>Personality is greatly influenced by their early socialization with people, and much less so by their breed or size. If you are interested in showing rabbits, then it is important to research and determine which breed most appeals to you. There are start-up and continual costs of keeping a rabbit. Potential rabbit owners may only consider the cost of the rabbit and cage, and not realize there will be regular annual costs as well as food, bedding, veterinary care, grooming, and flea prevention items, and an unending supply of chew toys.</p>

            <h2>Where to Find A Rabbit</h2>
            <p>House rabbits should be acquired through a reputable source. Rabbits are usually acquired through breeders, pet shops, and rescue agencies or shelters.
                If you are looking for a specific breed of rabbit, breeders will be the best source. You may be able to see the parents and/or siblings from previous litters. Rabbits from smaller breeders have usually been handled when they were young, which is critical for good socialization. And, breeders can be excellent sources of information, as well as providers of quality rabbits.</p>

            <p>You may also find a rabbit at a pet shop or feed store. Pet stores are convenient, may have several different breeds, and also carry many of the supplies you will need. The quality of care, knowledge of the staff, and information on the specific rabbit you would like to purchase can vary considerably from pet shop to pet shop.</p>

            <h2>What to Ask Before Taking Your Rabbit Home</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the rabbit kept in a clean cage with fresh water and a good diet?</li>
                <li>Is the rabbit housed with many others? If so, it could be exposed to more diseases and be under more stress. Male and female rabbits should be housed separately.</li>
                <li>Is the rabbit eating, or does it appear to have difficulty, which could indicate dental or other oral problems?</li>
                <li>Is the rabbit easily startled when approached?</li>
                <li>Is the rabbit alert and of optimal weight, with clear eyes, clean ears, and a well-kept coat? Or does it show any signs of illness such as sneezing, nasal discharge, lumps or bumps, lethargy, soiled areas around the tail, or patchy hair loss? Never buy a rabbit showing signs of illness, and have your rabbit checked by a knowledgeable veterinarian within 1-2 days of purchase.</li>
                <li>Does the seller have references you can contact?</li>
                <li>If the seller is a breeder, can you see the parents of the rabbit you would like to purchase? If at a pet shop, can the staff give you the origin of the rabbit?</li>
                <li>Are the sellers/staff knowledgeable?</li>
            </ul>
